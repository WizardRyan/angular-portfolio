<span>Hey, I'm Ryan.</span>
<span>It's nice to meet you.</span>
<span></span>
<span>I'm a developer.</span>
<span id="google">It means I can use Goog</span>
<span>It means I solve problems.</span>
<span></span>
<span id="skip">[{{skipContent}}]</span>
<span></span>
<span>Anyways, </span>
<span>Feel free to check out the rest of the site!</span>
<span>Or stay here while I talk about myself.</span>
<span></span>
<span>Basically,</span>
<span>I'm a huge nerd.</span>
<span>For a lot of things.</span>
<span>Sciences in particular.</span>
<span>I read far too many Wikipedia articles.</span>
<span></span>
<span>If we wanna talk about development, I've been programming since I was first introduced to it as a teenager.</span>
<span>I think it's immensley satisfying to solve problems as efficiently as possible with the constraints computers and logic gives you.</span>
<span></span>
<span>Automating things gets me excited too. (Who doesn't like eliminating a repetitive task?)</span>
<span>In fact, if I'm on a project long enough, I'll probably find ways to improve the exising system.</span>
<span></span>
<span>I think there's a good chance I'd be helpful to you.</span>
<span>So feel free to</span>
<a href="/contact">contact me</a>
<span>if you'd like me to be on your team.</span>
